## Agda
This folder contains the code for the case study Agda.

### Installing the tool
Agda is installed in a variety of ways, including using cabal-install from the Haskell ecosystem, pre-built binaries or the Nix package manager. 
However, Agda does not come installed with the standard library and there is no package manger for Agda.
Therefore, the installation of the Agda standard library requires some manual labour but is nevertheless straightforward.
